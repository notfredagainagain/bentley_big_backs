Campus Nutrition Advisor is a user-friendly web application designed to help Bentley University campus members make informed food choices based on their nutrition goals and dietary preferences. By leveraging The 921 dining hall's menu, the app enables users to discover suitable meals that align with their health objectives, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or maintaining a balanced diet.

Users can specify dietary goals and select from various preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, nut-free) to receive tailored meal recommendations. The app utilizes real-time web data from The 921's website to provide accurate, up-to-date food options, making it an essential tool for students and staff who seek to prioritize their nutrition and overall well-being.

With Campus Nutrition Advisor, making smart and health-conscious food choices on campus has never been easier!
